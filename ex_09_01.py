# Assignment
# Write a program that categorizes each mail message by which day of the week the commit was done.
# To do this look for lines that start with “From”, then look for the third word and keep a running count of each of the days of the week.
# At the end of the program print out the contents of your dictionary (order does not matter).
#
# Solution:

fhand = open('mbox-short.txt')

email=dict()
for line in fhand :
    if line.startswith('From ') :
        line = line.rstrip()
        words = line.split()
        day = words[2]
        email[day] = email.get(day,0) + 1
    else : continue

print(email)
